# Calculator App

A premium, production-grade Calculator application built with Flutter, focusing heavily on **Clean Architecture**, **SOLID principles**, strict **lints**, and **comprehensive testing**.

The application features a modern Material 3 design system with a responsive viewport (supporting mobile, tablet, portrait, and landscape orientations), tactile haptic feedback, and built-in screen-reader accessibility semantics.

## Architecture

This application is designed following **Clean Architecture** principles to separate business logic from the UI framework completely.

### 1. Presentation Layer (Flutter-dependent)
* **Widgets & Screens**: Decoupled layout components (`DisplayPanel`, `Keypad`, `CalculatorButton`) structured responsively.
* **CalculatorProvider**: Manages UI state and coordinates interaction gestures. It is completely isolated from parsing and mathematical computations, acting strictly as a state controller.
* **Themes & Styles**: Formulates the Material 3 light/dark style tokens (`AppColors`, `AppDimensions`, `AppTheme`).

### 2. Domain Layer (Pure Dart)
* **Token Model**: Represents individual arithmetic elements (operands and operators) immutably.
* **ExpressionParser**: Houses the tokenizer and implements the **Shunting-yard algorithm** to parse infix inputs into Postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) lists honoring operator precedence.
* **ValidatorService**: Enforces real-time input rules (e.g., blocking duplicate decimals, double operators) and validates full expressions.
* **CalculatorService**: Evaluates postfix tokens using a stack-based algorithm, formats results to a maximum of **4 decimal digits**, and handles division by zero error states.

## Design Decisions

1. **Provider State Management**: Chosen because it is lightweight, officially recommended, and integrates cleanly with Flutter's change notification system. Fine-grained rebuild optimizations are enforced via `Selector` structures on text nodes and `context.read` context boundaries for keys.
2. **Zero Evaluation Dependencies**: To ensure engineering quality, the tokenizer, parser, and stack evaluator were implemented completely from scratch in pure Dart without using packages like `petitparser` or `eval`.
3. **No Parentheses**: Excluded per user preference. The app only parses sequential infix expressions containing numbers and operators.
4. **4-Decimal Digit Precision**: Formats results to a maximum of 4 decimal places (e.g., `1 / 3` formats as `0.3333`, `0.1 + 0.2` formats as `0.3`), stripping any trailing zeros to clean up whole integers.
5. **Tactile Haptic Feedback**: Integrates Dart's native `HapticFeedback.lightImpact()` on key presses to simulate physical key feedback.
6. **Accessible Semantics**: Implements a mapped `Semantics` structure for all keys (e.g., `AC` announces as `"Clear All"`, `⌫` as `"Backspace"`), conforming to mobile screen-reader guidelines.

## How to Run

Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed and configured.

1. Clone or navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd projects/calculator_app
   ```
2. Fetch package dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## How to Test & Coverage

The test suite covers arithmetic correctness, edge cases, validation rules, state transitions, widget layouts, and responsive orientations.

* **Run all tests**:
  ```bash
  flutter test
  ```
* **Generate coverage reports**:
  ```bash
  flutter test --coverage
  ```
* **Verify coverage output**:
  The command outputs test coverage directly to `coverage/lcov.info`.

---

## Packages Used

* **`provider`**: Scoped state management injection.
* **`flutter_lints`**: Strict static analysis rules.
* **`flutter_test`**: Unit and widget testing frame.

---

## Future Improvements

* **Calculation History**: Add a local repository (using `shared_preferences` or `sqlite`) to persist past calculations.
* **Advanced Mathematical Constants**: Introduce constants like $e$ or $\pi$ using a dedicated constant model in the domain layer.
* **Keypad Customization**: Allow users to swap between standard keypad and a scientific keyboard layout.

---

## Known Limitations

* **Memory Precision Limits**: Numbers exceeding standard IEEE 754 64-bit double limits (around $1.79 \times 10^{308}$) will evaluate to `Infinity`.
* **No Parentheses**: Arithmetic expressions must be sequential (e.g., `3 + 5 × 2`). Precedence is strictly maintained via MDAS rules, but parentheses groupings are not supported by design.
